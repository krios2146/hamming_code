# hamming_code

Hamming codes are a family of linear error-correcting codes. Hamming codes can detect one-bit and two-bit errors, or correct one-bit errors without detection of uncorrected errors.

This is my shitty Hamming code (15,11) implementation with simple 1, 2 and 3 bits corruption simulation

Technically is Hamming code with additional parity check on the first bit, so it's SECDED - abbreviated from single error correction, double error detection
